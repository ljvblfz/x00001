elFinder servlet (Java/J2EE)
============================

Description
-----------

This is a Java connector (backend) for elFinder.

Important! This project is a generic library which can't be run directly.
All you need is to integrate it in your own project:
- as a maven dependency (org.elfinder:elfinder-servlet)
- or as an external Jar (jar is available in /jar directory)

Have a look to the "elfinder-servlet-demo" project to see a runnable example:
https://github.com/Studio-42/elfinder-servlet-demo


Features
--------

 * Basic operations (copy, move, upload, create folder/file, rename, etc.)
 * UTF-8
 * Multiple configurations, useful for setting up multiple user areas
 * Thumbnails

Requirements
------------

Server:
 * J2EE
 * Few libraries described in pom.xml (servlet-api, JSON, fileupload, mime-util)


Documentation
-------------

...doc is in da code, sorry :(

=> NEW! Have a look to "elfinder-servlet-demo" project to see a runnable project.

In a few words and as quick start guide, you should:

1. extend `AbstractConnectorConfig` to implement your own backend configuration (essentially to provide root directory, root URL and filesystem implementation - you may use `DiskFsImpl`) and eventually override default behaviors (like max upload size, date format...)
	See `my.demo.MyDemoConfig` for an example from the demo project
    
2. extend AbstractConnectorServlet and implement prepareConfig(), for returning your own backend configuration
	See `my.demo.MyDemoServlet` for an example from the demo project
    
3. then use your own servlet like any Java servlet (put it to your web.xml)
 
You may also:

* override default commands behaviors:

	`org.elfinder.servlets.commands.MkdirCommandOverride` overrides `org.elfinder.servlets.commands.MkdirCommand`
	`org.elfinder.servlets.commands.AbstractCommandOverride` overrides `org.elfinder.servlets.commands.AbstractCommand` (this is superclass of all commands)

* implement new commands by creating a new class like `org.elfinder.servlets.commands.YourOwnCommand` extending `AbstractCommandOverride`
